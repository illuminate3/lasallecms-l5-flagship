 *  Seems like a good idea because the standard front-end routes emanate from this package. But, not
 *  such a great idea when it's desirable to customize those routes.
 *
 *  To allow the "home" and "{slug}" to be customized -- or over-ridden -- I am extracting the two main
 *  routes out of my front-end package, and placing them here in my Flagship's route.php.
